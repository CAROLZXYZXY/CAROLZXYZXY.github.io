                <p>
                    As thanksgiving comes, I want to express my gratitude through this post to relieve my guilt.
                    Rada asked me yesterday what
                    I am happiest about the past year, and my response is that that I could be exposed to cutting-edge
                    research in this field.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tracing back this line, I want to thank my advisor Rada and Jag. When I was under the worst condition
                    this February (no internship, no research lab), Rada sincerely accepted my application to her lab.
                    From that time on, I started my fantastic journey in NLP. Even when I feel I don't want to continue
                    project LEAP this September, she gave me strong support towards my decision to quit the project. She
                    always encourages me to do what I'm interested in, and provides me, an undergraduate, a lot of opportunities
                    to discuss research. I also gain chances of meeting other people in academia, CCB from Upenn,
                    Graham Neubig from CMU, etc. She is a fantastic advisor, and I learn a lot from her not only about
                    research, but also lifestyle. I remember her word on the upside of stress, her comment on Appendix of 1984, which
                    gives me endless strength. Jag provided me a simulation environment of being a PhD Student during
                    the summer. And from that time on, I decided to pursue a PhD degree after my bachelor journey. I
                    clearly remembered the first time I met with Jag, even without saying hi, he directly asked whether
                    I want to pursue a PhD. Maybe this question would change my life, forever.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tracing back more, I'm grateful to Shiyu Zhang. She never got tired of giving me recognition when I
                    was inconfident. I couldn't imagine our friendship from Spanish Winter Program could last so long, and
                    so dense, until now. More importantly, she encouraged me to go to Jag's group, where I came
                    across my fantastic mentor Nikita. As Jag and Rada provided me the best research environment, Nikita let me here by
                    person. Thank you for her continuous care, no matter she was on campus, or during internship. I clearly
                    know that I'm quite bothering, and I have been consuming a lot of her time in helping me things that isn't in the
                    scope of research. Even recently my mind crashes, and I feel continuously hopeless and low, she never
                    got tired of relieving me and cheering me up. I feel sorry that I rarely act positively towards her
                    encouraging word, and I beg her forgiveness for my childish action and thoughts. I don’t intend to do so. I'm also grateful
                    to this special type friendship, between an Indian PhD student and a Chinese undergraduate student, which
                    I could never imagine before this happens. In this phase, thank you God for letting me experience the
                    tiny surprise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recently, I got a lot of trouble in gaining the courage of facing my day, my year and my life. One of
                    the worst feeling I have is guilty. Looking at my peers, I really feel I’m the fortunate one in a lot of
                    aspects. Because of that, I'm even more grateful to all the things I already have, sincerely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most importantly, I want to thank myself, my body and my mind. Me myself should be the strongest support
                    for this life. Under no circumstances I could give up. Happy Thanksgiving!
                </p>
