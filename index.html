                <p>
                    Greetings! I am Carol Xinyi Zheng, an undergraduate strudent
                    student at the <a href="https://www.umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a> studying
                    <a href="https://cse.umich.edu/">Computer Science
                        Engineering</a> and <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/math"> Mathematics</a> (Algorithmic Track). I am honorable to be in
                    a dual Bachelor's program from <a href="http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/">Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a>,
                    a prestigious university in China.<br>
                    My research interests lie in Intelligent Information Systems, Natural Language Processing and Computational Social Science.
                    Currently, I am a member of <a href="http://dbgroup.eecs.umich.edu/">Michigan
                    Database Group</a>, working on question answering system over knowledge base. I am also a member
                    of <a href="http://lit.eecs.umich.edu">Language and Information Technologies Group</a>, working on project
                    <a href="https://midas.umich.edu/research/leap/">LEAP</a>. Thanks my advisors <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/">
                    Prof. Mihalcea</a> and <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~jag/">Prof. Jagadish</a> for opening the
                    door of research for me.<br>
                    In the future, I want to research on understanding human's interaction with information systems and developing
                    new technologies for better human experience. I view Natural Language Processing and the
                    SOTA deep learning as a tool, instead of a research objective. I also cannot refuse to research for social good.
                    Here are some of my dream research topics in PhD Study (if I could be admitted to a PhD program):
                    task-oriented dialogue system, human-in-the-loop of text analytics system, knowledge base construction and application.
                    GO BLUE!

            <div class="in-content">
                For long time, traveling means spending time with parents (since my parents are super busy besides vacation
                time). After I graduated from high school, traveling means more about having fun with friends. We eat, we laugh,
                we play overnight without any life pressure. Recently, traveling contains another important activity: visiting
                friends. I started to choose the cities where I have close friends live, stay at their home, and reflect
                a lot during every single travel. Another important change is: I start to travel alone. Last fall, I went
                to Boston myself. This time, I went to the Bay Area.<br><br>

                There are two original motivations behind this travel. Firstly and most importantly, my high school deskmate Zijun Cui is
                going back home to China soon, after one year of exchanging in UCB. Secondly, my research intern mentor
                Nikita Bhutani is now interning in Mountain View. Our research project is in a critical stage now. And
                I feel it is necessary to talk face-to-face with her, clarifying about the project details, as well as
                exchanging recent thoughts. One subsequent motivation is that I've been working with Dr. Carmen Benea for
                several months remotely. It is good to visit her in Bay Area.<br><br>
            <p>
                [08/11] A2 -> Houston -> Oakland -> Berkley -> San Fransisco -> Mountain View<br>
                This is a super tired day! My flight is at 6am EST, I transferred in Houston, and finally arrived Oakland
                at 11am PST.<br>
                I met my close friend Zijun Cui, feeling so happy that she's found her direction of study.
                Berkley upsets me totally. The campus of UCB is old and under bad maintainence (worse than SJTU, not to say U of M).
                There are a lot of homeless people, and the saftey condition is quite bad in Berkley.<br>
                I've been to San Fransisco 11 years ago. The moment I arrived in that city, old memory comes up inevitably.
                I remembered as a child, I walked up and down in SF China Town. I remembered the scene of Golden State
                Bridge long back ago. But I don't like SF because of homeless people, and the sense of unsafety when wandering around.

                    [08/12] Palo Alto<br>
                    This is the second time I visit Stanford University. The moment I walked inside, the sense of longing
                    jumped out of my heart, attacking my mind all over the day. It has been my dream school for 11 years.

                    [08/13] Saratoga -> Mountain View<br>
                    I went to Yahoo HQ (Currently Oath) this morning with my friend Xiaoyu Fang, observing the life of
                    a software engineer. My primary feeling is that they have work-life balance. Typically, they don't
                    work after hours. But this feeling is shortly beaten in the afternoon when I visited Dr. Carmen Banea
                    in Saratoga. She lives on the hillside in Saratoga, where we can get a bird's view of the whole Bay Area.
                    Here is the picture scapturing inside her house.
                </p>

                </table>
                <p>
                    We sat outside, enjoyed cheesecake and flower tea and chatted the whole afternoon. I'm surprised by her
                    ever strong commitment to life and studying. Her husband works as a leader of a big team in Google. She
                    told me that thousands of thousands of software engineers suffer a lot if they want to get promotion.
                    My insight of work-life balance is only from the view of a desire-free state. Her husband works all
                    the time except sleeping hours. She, herself, finished PhD in under very hard circumstances. She
                    seriously said that, if she died, she was still happy. Because she was on the way of studying new
                    knowledge. Such
                    strong belief encourages me a lot. PhD is a venue of studying and producing new knowledge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At night, I met my research intern mentor, who has been tied up in her internship for a long time. Wish
                    her good luck :D
