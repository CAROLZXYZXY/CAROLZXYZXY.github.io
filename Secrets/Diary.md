# Preliminaries

Recently I am going through a rought patch in my mind. I started to doubt the meaning of life, the support of life, true happiness, etc. I went to CAPS on Nov.30th for help. Now I start to write down something everyday.


## Dec. 1st

It rains all day. Although I don't need to do research now, I stil get myself something to do. Minje said the paper is goint to ICSWM2019, so I decided to offer him some help. Nighttime is nightmare. Out NLP project needs to come out some results by Monday. But two of my teammates have spent a lot of time replicating this model, but they still cannot figure this out, and have a lot of problems. They came to my office, and asked for help. I'm really disappointed on that, and I spent a lot of time hands-on debug for them. Why a master student is like that?? My period comes today, so I feel really bad today. I actually has nothing to do with what happens today. Hope there's some sunshine tomorrow.


## Dec. 2nd

It is so hard to be a human. Today I wrote some code, and I went to Rada's home for a party. I have to say her home is so great, and really warm my heart. But it seems far away from my life. Our NLP project is so hard sometimes. There are still a bunch of things to do tomorrow. I feel much better when I answered questions on piazza. Maybe I need to teach more, to gain some positive feeling.
