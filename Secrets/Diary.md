# Preliminaries

Recently I am going through a rought patch in my mind. I started to doubt the meaning of life, the support of life, true happiness, etc. I went to CAPS on Nov.30th for help. Now I start to write down something everyday.


## Dec. 1st

It rains all day. Although I don't need to do research now, I stil get myself something to do. Minje said the paper is goint to ICSWM2019, so I decided to offer him some help. Nighttime is nightmare. Out NLP project needs to come out some results by Monday. But two of my teammates have spent a lot of time replicating this model, but they still cannot figure this out, and have a lot of problems. They came to my office, and asked for help. I'm really disappointed on that, and I spent a lot of time hands-on debug for them. Why a master student is like that?? My period comes today, so I feel really bad today. I actually has nothing to do with what happens today. Hope there's some sunshine tomorrow.


## Dec. 2nd

It is so hard to be a human. Today I wrote some code, and I went to Rada's home for a party. I have to say her home is so great, and really warm my heart. But it seems far away from my life. Our NLP project is so hard sometimes. There are still a bunch of things to do tomorrow. I feel much better when I answered questions on piazza. Maybe I need to teach more, to gain some positive feeling.

## Dec. 3rd

Today is a dramatic day. My mood is not that good actually. Firstly I'm bothered with NLP project. Next, I have 484 homework due tomorrow, but contents are taught today. I lose mood in front of my mentor, actually this is not the first time. She continuously encourages me to face the day. I feel relieved about that. At night we had a wonderful meeting, and Gavin pointed out the error we got when training out model. Hope my model works good today. Hope tomorrow is a good day. Smile & Be happy!

## Dec. 4th

Today is a good day! I feel good. Although there is still a lot of pressure of research, I feel that as long as there is someting going on, it is fine at all.

## Dec. 5th
A productive but so tired day. I did NLP presentation, and I wrote a bunch of network programs on generating features, which are all multi-processsing programs!! I feel a bit bad in the afternoon, maybe because looking at others' work, I am tooweak, and I don't deserve my title. I'm better at night. And I slept in my office today. It's too late, and I'm too lazy to go home as well

## Dec. 6th
Today is a hard but relieving day. I went to caps, and knew about cognitive behavioral therapy. Hope it works out. I need sleep!! I don't want to be headache.
Carol, don't be a should statement person at all!!

## Dec. 7th
Today is a fair day. I watched the documentary "Three Identical Strangers", and I did the laundry. Possiby the first rest day after a while.Carol, please don't stay up, and sleep early from today.

## Dec. 8th
Today is a fantastic day : )


## Dec. 25th
I was in Seattle from Dec. 21th - Dec. 24th, and then I came to Portland. Although this is the holiday in the States (which means nothing good to eat), I haven't enjoyed myself such for so long.
I had a three-hour karaoke, and watched the movie Love Actually at airbnb. I enjoyed the moment of singing so much, especially for the songs which brought my memory to the scene. What a wonderful day!
My parents will come soon. Hope all things are going well then.
