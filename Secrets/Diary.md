# Preliminaries

Recently I am going through a rought patch in my mind. I started to doubt the meaning of life, the support of life, true happiness, etc. I went to CAPS on Nov.30th for help. Now I start to write down something everyday.


## Dec.1st

It rains all day. Although I don't need to do research now, I stil get myself something to do. Minje said the paper is goint to ICSWM2019, so I decided to offer him some help. Nighttime is nightmare. Out NLP project needs to come out some results by Monday. But two of my teammates have spent a lot of time replicating this model, but they still cannot figure this out, and have a lot of problems. They came to my office, and asked for help. I'm really disappointed on that, and I spent a lot of time hands-on debug for them. Why a master student is like that?? My period comes today, so I feel really bad today. I actually has nothing to do with what happens today. Hope there's some sunshine tomorrow.
