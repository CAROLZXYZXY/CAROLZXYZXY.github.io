I am a Phd student in Computer Science Department. I am doing research in the intersection of Machine Learning, Human Computer Interaction and Data Management. 

Previously, I obtianed my Bachelor degree from the University of Michigan and Shanghai Jiao Tong University in Computer Science, Applied Mathematics and Electrical and Computer Engineering. 

I have also spent wonderful time at IBM Research and Apple SPG & AI/ML. 

I am currently interested in:
- large-scale algorithms for graphs and time series data (and the interplay, dynamic graphs), as well as their applications in various domains
- building user-friendly tools to automate data analytics and machine learning (visualization, insight generation, etc)
