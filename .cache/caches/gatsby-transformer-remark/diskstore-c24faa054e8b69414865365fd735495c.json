Currently, there is no standard practice\nfor reporting and sharing network datasets. Some network dataset\nproviders only share links, while others provide some contexts or\nbasic statistics. As a result, critical information may be unintention-\nally dropped, and network dataset consumers may misunderstand\nor overlook critical aspects. Inappropriately using a network dataset\ncan lead to severe consequences (e.g., discrimination) especially\nwhen machine learning models on networks are deployed in high-\nstake domains. Challenges arise as networks are often used across\ndifferent domains (e.g., network science, physics, etc) and have com-\nplex structures. To facilitate the communication between network\ndataset providers and consumers, we propose network report. A\nnetwork report is a structured description that summarizes and con-\ntextualizes a network dataset. Network report extends the idea of\ndataset reports (e.g., Datasheets for Datasets) from prior work with\nnetwork-specific descriptions of the non-i.i.d. nature, demographic\ninformation, network characteristics, etc. We hope network reports\nencourage transparency and accountability in network research\nand development across different fields.","position":{"start":{"line":3,"column":1,"offset":14},"end":{"line":22,"column":41,"offset":1313},"indent":[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":3,"column":1,"offset":14},"end":{"line":22,"column":41,"offset":1313},"indent":[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]}},{"type":"heading","depth":2,"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Supplemental materials","position":{"start":{"line":24,"column":4,"offset":1318},"end":{"line":24,"column":26,"offset":1340},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":24,"column":1,"offset":1315},"end":{"line":24,"column":26,"offset":1340},"indent":[]}},{"type":"heading","depth":3,"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Case Study","position":{"start":{"line":25,"column":5,"offset":1345},"end":{"line":25,"column":15,"offset":1355},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":25,"column":1,"offset":1341},"end":{"line":25,"column":16,"offset":1356},"indent":[]}},{"type":"list","ordered":true,"start":1,"spread":false,"children":[{"type":"listItem","spread":false,"checked":null,"children":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"High School Contact Network","position":{"start":{"line":26,"column":4,"offset":1360},"end":{"line":26,"column":31,"offset":1387},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":26,"column":4,"offset":1360},"end":{"line":26,"column":31,"offset":1387},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":26,"column":1,"offset":1357},"end":{"line":26,"column":31,"offset":1387},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":26,"column":1,"offset":1357},"end":{"line":26,"column":31,"offset":1387},"indent":[]}},{"type":"html","value":"<section id=\"contact\">\n  <div>\n    <iframe\n    src=\"assets/report/contact_v5.pdf#toolbar=0&navpanes=0&scrollbar=0\"\n    frameBorder=\"0\"\n    scrolling=\"auto\"\n    height=\"600pt\"\n    width=\"100%\"\n></iframe>\n  </div>\n</section>","position":{"start":{"line":28,"column":1,"offset":1389},"end":{"line":38,"column":11,"offset":1611},"indent":[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"We use the high school contact network as an example of a social network.
