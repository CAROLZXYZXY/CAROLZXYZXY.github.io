Currently, there is no standard practice\nfor reporting and sharing network datasets. Some network dataset\nproviders only share links, while others provide some contexts or\nbasic statistics. As a result, critical information may be unintention-\nally dropped, and network dataset consumers may misunderstand\nor overlook critical aspects. Inappropriately using a network dataset\ncan lead to severe consequences (e.g., discrimination) especially\nwhen machine learning models on networks are deployed in high-\nstake domains. Challenges arise as networks are often used across\ndifferent domains (e.g., network science, physics, etc) and have com-\nplex structures. To facilitate the communication between network\ndataset providers and consumers, we propose network report. A\nnetwork report is a structured description that summarizes and con-\ntextualizes a network dataset. Network report extends the idea of\ndataset reports (e.g., Datasheets for Datasets) from prior work with\nnetwork-specific descriptions of the non-i.i.d. nature, demographic\ninformation, network characteristics, etc. We hope network reports\nencourage transparency and accountability in network research\nand development across different fields.</p>\n<h2>Supplemental materials</h2>\n<h3>Case Study</h3>\n<h4>1. High School Contact Network**</h4>\n<section id=\"contact\">\n  <div>\n    <iframe\n    src=\"assets/report/pokec_v2.pdf#toolbar=0&navpanes=0&scrollbar=0\"\n    frameBorder=\"0\"\n    scrolling=\"auto\"\n    height=\"600pt\"\n    width=\"100%\"\n></iframe>\n  </div>\n</section>\n<p>We use the high school contact network as an example of a social network. The network is created in the interdisciplinary SocioPatterns [1] project to study human contact behavior.\nThe network report is shown in below.\nThe network follows general characteristics of social networks: large triangle counts and clustering coefficient, power-law distribution of degrees, etc.\nThus methods for analyzing social networks could be applied to this network.\nAs the data is collected by wearable sensors that exchange ultra-low power  radio packets, the sensors may detect false positive contact if students' physical distance is close (e.g., deskmates).\nAs a result, the network may be biased towards in-class contacts.\nInfluence models and vaccination strategies developed for this dataset may not generalize to other datasets.\nFurthermore, there are only 327 nodes in the network, but the average degree is > 1000.\nNetwork dataset consumers may consider data structures other than sparse matrices to speed up certain computations (e.g., eigenvalue decomposition).\nVisualization researchers may be interested in developing specific techniques for such 'edge clutter' networks, as opposed to 'node clutter' networks such as Figure 1 (in the manuscript). </p>\n<h4>2. MOOC Action Network</h4>\n<section id=\"mooc\">\n  <div>\n    <iframe\n    src=\"assets/report/mooc_v2.pdf#toolbar=0&navpanes=0&scrollbar=0\"\n    frameBorder=\"0\"\n    scrolling=\"auto\"\n    height=\"600pt\"\n    width=\"100%\"\n></iframe>\n  </div>\n</section>\nTo show an example of a network report for an ML dataset, we use MOOC action network, which is built on top of KDD Cup 2015 [2]. \nThis user action dataset represents the actions taken by users on a popular MOOC platform.\nThe primary task is edge classification, i.e., to predict if an edge is the last action before the student dropouts the class.\nThe network report is shown below. \nFrom the description of data split, network dataset consumers could get insights that edge classification should be conducted in an 'inductive learning' paradigm, as new students could be added to the network in validation and test sets. \nThus transductive learning methods such as Deepwalk [3] could not be used in this task. \nSince all participants come from China, the model trained with this network may not be suitable for predicting dropout in other MOOC platforms outside China, because students in different countries may have different learning habits. \nAs shown in the `Frequency of label' bar plot, the labels are pretty imbalanced, i.e., 1% versus 99%. \nThus network dataset consumers could consider imbalanced classification techniques (e.g., under sampling the majority class) or one class classification methods when building models. \n<h3>User Study - Supplemental Materials</h3>\n<section id=\"pokec\">\n  <div>\n    <iframe\n    src=\"assets/report/contact_v5.pdf#toolbar=0&navpanes=0&scrollbar=0\"\n    frameBorder=\"0\"\n    scrolling=\"auto\"\n    height=\"600pt\"\n    width=\"100%\"\n></iframe>\n  </div>\n</section>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<!-- ### Header 3\n\nBrute-force intercepting traffic fiber connection system boot up fsociety reboot AFK sys admin.
