                    Hello! My Chinese name is Xinyi Zheng(郑欣怡), just pronounce as your English usage. My English name is
                    Carol, most of my international friends call me Carol. <a href="./img/car_plate.jpeg">THIS</a> is an interesting picture.I was born and brought up in
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai">Shanghai</a>, until I came to
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Arbor">Ann Arbor</a>,
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan">Michigan</a>
                    in August, 2017.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was born on June 5th, 1997, at
                    <a href="http://fckyy.fudan.edu.cn/e_show/en_introduction">Margaret Williamson Red House Hospital</a>.
                    My grandmother told me my birth day is a sunny day. However, my mum suffered giving birth to me
                    because of malpresentation. So my birthday every year is not only a day to celebrate my growth, but
                    also a remainder for me to be grateful to my mum. Under the background of
                    "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-child_policy">one-chlid policy</a>", a newborn in
                    China is
                    the center of the whole big family, and I was no exception. My grandparents and parents took care of
                    every need of me during my early childhood.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My memory begins at my grandparents' home in
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xujiahui">Xujiahui</a>. Since I had congenitial
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astigmatism">astigmatism</a> inheriting from my dad, I started
                    to wear glasses at three years old. Generally I had vague impression on
                    the room arrangement, but one scene is very clear. One of the neighbours often
                    called me "Dr. Zheng" because of the glasses, and encouraged me to study hard in the future. Life in
                    Xujiahui ended very soon, then I went to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pudong">Pudong</a>.

                <p>
                    In 1990, seven years before my birth, China proclaimed the development and opening-up of Shanghai's
                    Pudong, then vast stretches of farmland and villages. A lot of companies constructed bases in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pudong">Pudong</a>,
                    and high-rise buildings grew at fastest pace. My big family subsequently moved to
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pudong">Pudong</a> (I cannot remember the exact year).
                    At the intersection of 1980s and 1990s, my parents graduated and started to work. Fortunately, there
                    both worked in
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lujiazui">Lujiazui</a>, a financial center of Shanghai, where my
                    dad worked in a big commercial bank, and my mum worked in a investment corporation.
                    We three formed the typical middle-class core family in Shanghai.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is a typical phenomenon that middle-class parents want to cultivate their "child" sense of art and
                    and boost development of their "child's" intelligence, not excepting my parents. I was enforced to play
                    piano when I was in kindergarten. But as a young child, I actually don't like piano. I needed to sit
                    in front of the piano, and practice the same song once and once again. I gave up piano very soon, which
                    gave me a chance to be exposed to <a href="#">GO</a>. However, starting from the end of 20 years old,
                    I started to practice piano again! Please Check <a href="./video/later_piano.mp4">THIS VIDEO</a>! I
                    feel like, when I was young, I didn't develop the ability to enjoy music. For the really busy and
                    stressful summer (SU2018), I treat playing piano as calming down, and gaining a peaceful secret place
                    inside my soul. Thank you my fantastic piano teacher <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hyojin.j.moon">
                    Jenna</a>, who continuously care for me on my journey in the piano world!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I did my primary school at <a href="http://www.psfshl.pudong-edu.sh.cn/">Fushan Foriegn Language Primary
                    School</a>. I clearly remembered that at the first day of officially being a student, I cried loudly in
                    the class in front of the whole class, because I missed my family during the school time. Looking back
                    from now, I think another reason is that, I didn't accept the role of Student in my heart at that time.
                    The first three years of primary school time passed quickly without much memory. Everyday my parents sent
                    to school at 7:30 a.m.; my grandpa picked me up at 4:30 p.m.; I played in the neighbourhood with friends.
                    4th year of primary school is the first time for me to experience pressure, even before I understood
                    what exactly the meaning of "pressure" is.
